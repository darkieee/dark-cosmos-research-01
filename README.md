# ARG
Artificially Redshifting Galaxies with a neural network

## Instructions for generating galaxy images and training the neural network:

### Dependancies:

- Numpy
- Scipy
- Astropy
- H5PY
- Six
- Sklearn
- Tensorflow

### Clone and install SMPY --> https://github.com/darkieee/dark-cosmos-research-01.git

`git clone git://darkieee/dark-cosmos-research-01.git`

`python setup.py install`

### Run the scripts

Run `candels_example.py` from the `scripts` folder of SMPY to generate the galaxy SED information used by `galaxies.py`.

Run `galaxies.py` from the `scripts` folder to generate `n` simulated galaxy images.

Run `redshifting.py` from the `scripts` folder to apply observational effects to the `n` galaxy images.

Run `Galaxies_VAE.py`from the `scripts` folder to train the network and produce image reconstructions, a 2D plot in latent space, and plot of model loss on training and validation sets.

### Additional scripts

`galaxies2.py` can be used to generate compound galaxy images.

`galaxies_asym.py` can be used to generate asymmetric galaxy images.

### Note

The outputs of `galaxies.py` and `redshifting.py` will be `.npy` files.

`testplot.py` shows how the numpy arrays can be read and displayed.
